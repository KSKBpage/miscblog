#### Dear UE committee members:

There are a lot of news reports, that the UTM SE got rejected by Apple. I think this violates the Digital Markets Act in the EU.  

Not only blocked from the App Store but also refuses to notarization, making it impossible to appear in third-party app stores within the European Union.  

UTM SE is an open-source application that allows us to run x86 emulation in iOS and iPadOS.  
Source code: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM  

The app is kinda like Parallel Desktop / VirtualBox / Vmware / qemu. It doesn't steal user data or do anything bad to users.  
It's just a PC simulator, that allows users to run PC operation systems on iPadOS such as Windows, Ubuntu, etc.  
But it still gets rejected by Apple.  

This is just my guess: Even though it doesn't do anything bad to users, it does something bad to Apple.  
Running a PC emulator makes it possible to run virtual MacOS or any PC-level productive apps on an iPad, which may reduce sales to the Macbook.  

Apple wants any PC simulator can be available on MacOS, to prevent iPadOS too competitive to extrude the sails of the Macbook. In the latest iPad, it's lighter, has a more powerful M4 chip better than the M3 chip on the MacBook, it has a touchscreen that the Macbook doesn't have. If an iPad is enough, users may not want to buy an additional MacBook. And this is just my guess.  

But even though it's just my guess, they donâ€™t only check for malware or bad to users, etc. But they seem to have the same rules and only consider the profit of Apple for apps on third-party marketplaces making them completely useless.  

In the user aspect, they are forced to buy a Macbook, instead of running a virtual machine on an iPad.  
From any developer's aspect, any app violates Apple's rule, and even though it's beneficial to users, it still gets prohibited. Even from third-party marketplaces.  

There is a discussing thread on Reddit to take a reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOniOS/comments/1dbobpc/utm_se_rejected_from_appstore_and_3rd_party  

In my point of view, I support the notarization policy, which blocks malware from users. But Apple's notarization policy not only blocks malware but also blocks anything bad( like PC simulators on iOS and iPadOS ) to Apple, which is anti-competitive I think.  

Please take a look at this anti-competitive notarization policy of Apple, many thanks.  

Best regards.
